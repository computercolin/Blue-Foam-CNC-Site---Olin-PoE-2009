                <span style="font-size: 1.2em">Hyeontaek is attending Olin only until he can find an inexpensive  trans-oceanic vessel that will return him to his home college,  KAIST(Korea Advanced Institute of Science Technology) in South Korea.  Scientists are currently studying Hyeontaek because of his language  facilities. In order to communicate in English, Hyeontaek mentally  translates from Korean, to the C programming language, to English. This  is one of only a few isolated cases where a technical language is used  as a psychological transfer construct.<br />
                <br />
If Hyeontaek were to cut a scene out of extruded polystyrene, it would  include C code and several pics linked by SPI under the full, sleepless moon.</span></div>

Through this project Travis has become a master at biking everywhere, including the trips to The Home Depot. Travis  worked primarily on designing the x axis and gearbox, machining, and  assembling the mechanical system of the blue foam CNC device.<br />
                <br />
                If Travis were to cut a scene out of extruded polystyrene,  it would be a recursive image of a CNC blue foam cutter cutting a CNC blue foam cutter which is cutting a CNC blue foam cutter which is cutting out the phrase  &quot;everything I needed to know about life I learned in the machine shop.&quot;</span><br />

                <p> Colin stumbled into the foam CNC project through a gross  miscommunication between himself and his hall-mates. Directed to &quot;save  the world,&quot; Colin believed&nbsp; he was meant promote the development of  cancer, release dioxins into the air, and further the dumping of  hazardous materials into water systems. Colin thus joined the CNC team  and vowed to make extruded polystyrene a hot commodity. In his free  time, Colin enjoys visiting the dentist. <br />
                </p>
              <p> If Colin were to cut a scene out of extruded polystyrene, it would  include a mill, several broken taps embedded deep in aluminum parts, a  convoluted set of Java libraries, a giant tangled mess of wires, an  8P8C crimping tool, CSS-HTML, and the message &quot;I heart documentation.&quot;</p>
