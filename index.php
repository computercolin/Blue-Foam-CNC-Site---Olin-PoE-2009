                    To the uninitiated, extruded polystyrene, a household and nautical insulator, is commonly used by product designers to prototype designs. Because of emphasis on design here at Olin College, from day one Oliners become attached to our beloved blue polystyrene, or "blue foam." as we call it. But as useful as "blue foam" is for design work, it is not the easiest stuff to work with. Getting beautiful, pristine, designer cuts with "blue foam" is tricky. And forget cutting a perfect circle from the stuff.

				<h1>The CNC Project</h1>
				<div class="body">
					<p>
                    This semester, 5 fledgling members of the Principles of Engineering course at Olin College created a CNC machine for extruded polystyrene. At approximately 3 ft by 3 ft by 3ft, our CNC machine is a monster and can cut foam sheets up to 2.5 ft square and 1 ft thick.  Our goal this semester was to create a CNC device capable of cutting 2-D profiles in blue foam. Technically our machine is capable of making such cuts, however we have not fully implemented the ability to manually program jobs. For the time being, the blue foamCNC machine is limited to making test cuts that have been coded into memory.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Our machine is composed of:
					<ul>
						<li>Two X-Y cutting modules, mirrored</li>
						<li>4 gear reduction boxes</li>
						<li>A polystyrene mounting rig</li>
                        <li>A 5 Microchip PIC circuit, acting as motor controllers for 4 high speed motors and encoders</li>
                        <li>Desktop software to convert standard DXF drawings and SVG files into PIC instructions</li>
					</ul>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    This CNC machine is not just a class project. We use "blue foam" a lot at Olin College, and our team hopes to use the machine in other work. Going further, we would like to perfect our machine and make it simple enough that any Olin student could use it to cut foam, as well as reliable enough to make available as a public resource.
